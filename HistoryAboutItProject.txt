Hi, today, namely 14.05.2022, I'm starting to create my first project on Github.
So far, I have not yet decided on what topic the project will be on.
Every day or 2 I will replenish this file.Write down your achievements in the project here.
At the moment I am 11 years old
.I've been studying Python for about 3 years.
Only today I found out about GitHub.
My wish is to become a programmer, to go to San Francisco.
Bye!
Love.
